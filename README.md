Unit Converter GUI Application

This project is a simple and interactive unit converter developed using Python and Tkinter. It helps users convert values between different units of Length, Weight, and Temperature through a graphical user interface.

The application features a clean and easy-to-use layout, allowing users to enter a value, select a category, choose a unit, and view converted values in multiple other units instantly. It also handles errors gracefully by alerting users if invalid data is entered.

Technologies used in this project include Python, Tkinter (for GUI), ttk (for styling), and messagebox (for error prompts). The interface is built to be responsive and user-friendly, making it accessible for all levels of users.

This project can be extended in the future to include more unit categories such as volume, time, speed, and currency, as well as additional features like dark mode and history tracking.
